# Robot arm!
this stuff is for the robot arm at HHS. It will have: the code for the arduino(s?) that do the base level motor control, some simple python examples for the higher-level raspberry pi control that will talk to the arm, some pictures, some schematics, the CAD for the first hand, and whatever else I feel like putting in it that relates.
