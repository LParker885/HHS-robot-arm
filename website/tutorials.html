           <center> <h2>Raspberry Pi setup</h2> </center>
      To set up your Raspberry Pi so that it can communicate with the robot arm, you will need to follow a few steps. 
      <ol>
<li>
  Go to the Raspberry Pi setup application and under interfaces, turn on SSH. 
</li>
<br>
<li>
  Open a new terminal window and run the following:  pip3 install HHS-Robotarm
  It should install without any errors.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Make sure that you have a python IDE installed. If you don't or don't know if there is one, I reccomend mu - run the following in a new terminal: <br>
sudo apt-get install mu-editor
<br>
It should show up in the menu under "programming"
</li>
<br>
<li>
  Double check the python package intallation: open up your python IDE and create a new file with these lines:
  <br>
  from RobotArm import Robotarm
   
  arm = Robotarm.Robot()
  <br>
   If there is a "connection not found" error after a bit, everything went well (as long as no errors show up immediatley, everything should be fine). 
</li>
      </ol>
      With that, your pi should be all set up and happy!

<h2>Turning on the arm!</h2>
</center>
There are a lot of switches on the robot arm. Be aware that in order to not break the arm, they must be flipped in a specific sequence. 
<br>
With that warning out of the way, here are the switches to flick and when to flick them, from left to right along the switch panel:
<br>
<h3>
Main disconnect <b>-</b> RPi power <b>-</b> Arduino power <b>-</b> Motor power
</h3>

Mounted to the top of the chassis is an E-Stop button, for when things go wrong - 
Hitting it will stop all motion and disconnect motor controller power. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
To get started, connect the power cable to the socket and<strong> <strong>only</strong> </strong>turn on the main power switch and the RPi power switch. 
This will give power to the raspberry pi mounted inside of the robot arm. 
<br>
Next, take the ethernet cable from inside the chassis and connect the free end of it to your Raspberry Pi's ethernet jack. Make sure wifi is turned off on your Pi.
<br>
You shold see two little arrows in the corner of your screen flash and after ~30 seconds turn solid blue. This means that the ethernet is connected 
to the pi in the chassis. 
<br>
<br>
Open up a new terminal window and type the following to open up a terminal on the pi inside the arm: ssh pi@169.254.126.87
<br>
It will prompt you for a password, which is "eagles"
<br>
<h4>
Congratulations! you have successfuly powered on the arm. 
</h4>
</p>
<p>
  <center>
<h2>First movements!</h2></center>

Now that you are connected to the robot arm, you probably want it to go zip! Here's how:<br>
<br>
In your python editor of choice on your raspberry pi, type the following code:<br>
from RobotArm import Robotarm<br>
arm = Robotarm.Robot()<br>
arm.go()<br>
arm.interpolate([110,90,90,90,90,90,90],20,3)<br>
arm.stop()<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Pay attention to this bit - it is the procedure you have to follow each time you want to run a program!</h4>
Save it, then make sure you have a terminal window open that is ssh-ed into the robot arm. <br>
First, turn on the switch for arduino power and reset the e-stop switch, if necessary. <br>
then, in that window, type the following: ./robot.sh <br>
after a few seconds, the letter "A" should appear. <br>
This is your acknowledgement that the arm is connected.<br> 
You can now turn on the motor power switch. <br>
<br>
Run the program you just typed in your python IDE, and the arm should scoot! <br>
YAY!<br>
<br>
Now, to turn it off, flip both the motor power and arduino power switches to off. <br>
Run the command in the terminal that is sshed into the robot arm (where the "A" appeared at the start): sudo shutdown now <br>
Wait 15 seconds, and flip the main power and RPi power switches to off. <br>
Then, shut down your pi and give the robot arm a high-five! <br>
